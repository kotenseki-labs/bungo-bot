BungoBot v3.19 (Pro) on 2026.2.3

**User:** 古人も多く旅に死せるあり。

**BungoBot:** Let's begin our analysis with the main predicate at the very end of the sentence: あり. What is the dictionary form (shūshikei) of this verb, and which specific conjugation column/class (katsuyō) does it belong to?

**User:** It is in the 終止形

**BungoBot:** Correct. What is the conjugation class (katsuyō) of this verb?

**User:** That is irrelevant right now. I need to understand the sentence so that I can read and translate in class.

**BungoBot:** Understood; to translate accurately, we must break down the grammar of the words modifying that final verb. Looking immediately before ari, we have 死せる (shiseru). This is a combination of a verb and a suffix (auxiliary verb). What is the dictionary form (shūshikei) of the verb part of this word?

**User:** I guess it is shi-su, a sahen verb appended to a noun

**BungoBot:** You are correct that the base is shisu (a Sa-hen verb). However, in the text shiseru (死せる), the verb appears as the stem shise-followed by the ending -ru. What specific auxiliary verb (jodōshi) does this -ru represent in its attributive form (rentaikei)?

**User:** I am gonna guess it is り in the 連体形

**BungoBot:** Correct. Given the context of "dying," does this auxiliary verb ri (り) indicate an ongoing action (progressive) or a resulting state (perfective) here?

**User:** resulting likely, but not 100% sure

**BungoBot:** You are correct; here, り indicates a resulting state (Perfective/Stative)—meaning the action has occurred and the state persists ("have died"). Since shiseru (死せる) is in the Attributive Form (rentaikei), but is followed immediately by the verb ari (あり) rather than a noun, what implied word or grammatical function do we assume exists between shiseru and ari?

**User:** 者

**BungoBot:** Yes, supplying "者" (or considering the rentaikei as acting nominally) makes the structure "there are [ones] who have died." Moving leftward to 旅に (tabini), what is the grammatical function of the particle に here in relation to the verb shiseru?

**User:** Hold on, why is the す a せ before り?

**BungoBot:** To understand the form shise-, we look at the connection rule for the auxiliary verb ri (り). Ri (り) attaches specifically to the Izenkei (Perfective Base) of Yodan verbs and the Mizenkei (Irrealis Base) of Sa-hen verbs. Since we established shisu (死す) is a Sa-hen verb, what is its Mizenkei form?

**User:** That explains it, thanks, we can proceed with the analysis, although the rest of the sentence is pretty straightforward. I would be happy to move on to translation

**BungoBot:** Since you are confident with the remaining vocabulary and structure, please provide your paraphrase or translation of the full sentence: 古人も多く旅に死せるあり.

**User:** Among the people of old, many have found their death on the road.

**BungoBot:** That is an excellent translation. It captures both the stative nature of shiseru ("found their death" implies the resulting state) and the existential structure of ari. Please provide the next section of the text.
